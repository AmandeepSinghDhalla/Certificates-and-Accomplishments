# Certificates-and-Accomplishments
One always appreciates the recognition and praise that he gets as a result of constant hard work and grinding daily to achieve their dream. The same stands true for me. I this repository, I will share with you guys my little accomplishments which motivate me to go further and work even hard.

## Applied Machine Learning with Python - IBM
In this course, I learned all the basic concepts behind the Machine Learning Algorithms which included the maths behind them anf their cost functions. I also learned their implementation on various real life datasets using python

## Business Analytics with Tableau - Data Trained
In this respective course, I learned how we can perform analysis and get useful insights from them. This is half the step, presenting them to the stakeholders and buisness team is very important. I also learned how we can use informative yet beautiful Dashboards to present our findings to the stakeholders.

## PG Program in Data Science, Machine Learning & Neural Networks - Data Trained with IBM
This diploma course was my very first interaction with the amazing world of Data Science. I took this course to begin my learning about the Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Neural Networks and much more. It encouraged me to learn more and further deep dive into the Data Science. Starting from basic maths and statistics all the way to building complex machine learning and neural networks, I started learning it all in this course.
